      <p>The decision to merge Aurora today wasn't a shocking one. Aurora has been a dormant server ever since Devon's raid. We all thought it'd be coming. Admit it. Espi, who is "super passionate" about Aurora, is at the forefront of its death, especially
        with the merge of NC Network. It's probably for the best, however. <a onclick="show('trm-expand'); this.style.display = 'none'" title="Click to expand this message" class="expando"><span class="arrow-down">&raquo;</span> Expand</a><span id="trm-expand"
          style="display: none;"><br><br>In conclusion, I think we should all take a lesson from this. The biggest lesson here is to hire reputable, caring staff who won't just let some guy steal his token. Remember Aurora mostly for its strong points, not its weak.<br><br>Thanks for all the support in Aurora over the years. It's genuinely appreciated, from the bottom of my heart. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i> <br><br>Best wishes,<br>~TRM</span></p>

      <p>Aurora Community, some of the best times of my life. When making the community with Devon, I never thought it would grow the the level it did. There was no drama, everyone was friends and it was... amazing. I will miss Aurora and the memories attached
        to it. Aurora was something truly beautiful. </p>

      <h1 id="message-rei"><a href="#message-rei">Reign I</a></h1>
      <p>I joined Aurora to get to know Sam and his friends and hopefully become friends with him and make some content together which thankfully happened. I'm honestly glad I joined because I made so many new friends and so much new content and it's really
        been a blast for me. I can't wait to see where the community goes next and who'll be following it. I'll miss you aurora, thanks for everything <i class="twa twa-heart"></i></p>

      <h1 id="message-ren"><a href="#message-ren">Renekton</a></h1>
      <p>Befriending torazer helped me accept that i was a furry, everyone in the server helped me out when I was at my lowest point when I couldn't sleep due to the pressure and discomfort that I felt when I had to come out to my parents and my depression
        that happened after some s__t with my parents</p>

      <h1 id="message-sun"><a href="#message-sun"><span>Rhys</span> SunburntRock89</a></h1>
      <p>It's sad to see Aurora go, it was one of the best communities ever. I became friends with most of Squadron there. I felt accepted there. I'm gonna miss it.</p>

      <h1 id="message-tec"><a href="#message-tec"><span>Josh</span> Technach</a></h1>
      <p>Aurora was the main hub for all of us for the longest time. We were all together, no drama, no "piddo" accusations, no slander, just us, and many, many others being one in a server. It was something special, we had something very little servers
        had, yes sometimes we we experienced a bit of internal drama along the way but we pulled through just fine. Since the server was created it's always been something important to me and has always had a special place in my heart, even during it's
        dark ages. <a onclick="show('technach-expand'); this.style.display = 'none'" title="Click to expand this message" class="expando"><span class="arrow-down">&raquo;</span> Expand</a><span id="technach-expand" style="display: none;">I met many, many people in this server, and strengthened my friendships with people I already know, and got to know people like Sam and Devon a lot more personally. And at a time when I was just some lonely f__k sitting in my room talking
        to people, Aurora was always there. This sounds stupid, but some of my greatest moments were on Aurora and I'll never forget everything that happened and all the enjoyment we got out of it. But in the end, something like this had to happen. The
        server had it too good for too long, so myself and Squadron decided to leave. Since then, Devon took over as the main owner, and we were no longer *together*. Devon got f__ked in the head and did some horrible (now forgiven) things to us, so he
        took Aurora completley into his own hands and thats were the servers downfall began. Of course it was raided later on, and refreshed by Haden, but even then he lost interest and couldn't find time or energy to keep the server alive. The place
        we once called home was now just this leech trying to feed off of it's former self. In it's current state, the server definetley needed to go. But it will always leave a significant mark in my heart and can now be remembered as the (former) centre
        on Discord, rather than the dump it left off as. I love you Aurora, I look forward to the future of us as people on Discord and see hope in whatever happens next, on our next big stop on this long road called life.</span></p>

      <h1 id="message-til"><a href="#message-til">Tilda</a></h1>
      <p>Ever since I've joined Aurora, it's changed my Discord experience for the better, as a welcoming and super fun community.<br>I'll miss you, Aurora.</p>

      <h1 id="message-ttt"><a href="#message-ttt">TTtie</a></h1>
      <p>It's actually sad to see Aurora leaving. Honestly, since Devon nuking the server, it has lost all of its reputation; cucking with 3000 members wasn't ever a good idea. So, see you in NC soon. <i class="twa twa-wave"></i></p>

      <h1 id="message-vap"><a href="#message-vap"><span>Isaac</span> Vaporwave</a></h1>
      <p>I joined WWP back in the day to meet Sam and his freinds, then I got mod and its members became like a family to me, then It got remade into Aurora and I joined that and never got my rank, So i waited, until I got Moderator and now I cant wait for
        whats next for AR/NC!</p>

      <h1 id="message-vla"><a href="#message-vla">Vlad</a></h1>
      <p>Aurora. Oh boy. I've been here ever since ScamCentral was a thing. I remember like it was yesterday how much fun we all had in Aurora.. But then, drama happened, it got nuked, and we tried to recover it. Unfortunately.. We weren't strong enough.
        <a onclick="show('vla-expand'); this.style.display = 'none'" title="Click to expand this message" class="expando"><span class="arrow-down">&raquo;</span> Expand</a><span id="vla-expand" style="display: none;"><br><br>It makes me sad to see that aurora is having its.. "sunset".. I've made a lot of friends thanks to Aurora, and it sucks that things happened the way they did.<br><br>I'll miss Aurora. It was fun, but all good things come to an end eventually... Goodbye Aurora, you will be missed..<br>Best of wishes and love from Vlag.<br><br>- Vlad, the "old" CEO of Aurora</span></p>

      <p>Aurora was a server I used to be staff in, sad to see it go really. Good luck to all of the staff in the future.</p>

      <h1 id="message-xso"><a href="#message-xso"><span>David</span> xSolidFigure</a></h1>
      <p>I really love this place, it was fun to communicate with people (including Da532, Red_Eye_Computing, and other well-known staff). Not only that, you can also enjoy fun events, such as Karaoke Night. This is why I loved the place so much, and I had
        a good time spending there. Of course, I'm not always active in Aurora Community, since I have to moderate other servers. Thank you Aurora, you'll be remembered. I will see you in NC Network, where we make more fun together.<br><br>Peace out everyone,
        and signing off!<br>-xSolidFigure</p>
