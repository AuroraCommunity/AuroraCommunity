      <p>Even though Aurora and I have had a rough history, I still love it with all of my heart. Without Aurora, NC Network would be a private, awful server from my old friends, I would not have became as well known, met many people, and grown. I would
        not be alive, I was suicidal one night in Aurora and people actually cared. They talked me out of it. Now that Aurora is gone, it feels bad, but it was the correct thing to do. Goodbye, Aurora. I will always remember you and keep you in my heart.<br>From
        WindowsWorld to Aurora to NC - I love you all. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i></p>

      <p>Aurora Community or Aurora, or whatever you call this server, this was REC's and Devon's server when it was first born. This server was created to be a community for Da532's fans and also REC's fan too, and for people to discuss about scambaiting,
        technology, and a lot more! This community kept growing and growing into a very massive community with over 3,000 members until one day... this server got NUKED! Ever since the nuke, the server never got restored back where it was before. I guess
        it's time to officially end this server once for all. The server will be closing <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?msg=Aurora+Community+Archival+Event&iso=20171027T20&p1=179">this Friday</a>.<br><br>Thank you all for
        being part of the Aurora Community, this server has a lot of memories, without you people this server wouldn't of lasted this long.<br><br>Goodbye Aurora Commmunity for the last time, we hope we see you in NC Network.</p>

      <p>Aurora is somethings that special to not only myself but also to my heart. It's a place where I've met a lot of friends and servers. I agree that its best era was before Armada (now Novus) was a thing. I remember when I got banned here because everyone
        thought that I was Tim, with him in the crashie brand and all, lol. With all that being said, I'll definitely miss this place and all the good times I've had for sure.<br><br>Goodbye Aurora.</p>

      <p>I most likely would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for aurora<br>Reminded of bob, joined bpc<br>Someone mentions sll, so I joined it<br>Espi gave me an invite to nc suuuuuuuuuper long ago, applied for staff and that’s what changed my life.<br>Me
        getting that staff<br>It boosted my confidence<br>It’s sad to see aurora go<br>But I feel like it’s for the best</p>

      <h1 id="da532"><span>Devon</span> Da532</h1>
      <p>Honestly, Aurora is like my child and like an insane mother I tried to smother it with a pillow, put an end to my evil child. The fact it's continued living so long has really shocked me but it's finally getting what it deserves.<br><br><u>RIP AURORA</u><br><br>You'll
        always hold a place in my heart. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i></p>

      <p>When I first joined Aurora it changed my life and Discord experince<br>I love all the people here and will still do. Aurora even knowing that it wont be alive anymore it will live on in our hearts</p>

      <p>Well, its closing. I found Aurora from SSL whenever drama came here, I somehow worked my way up to Admin, before leaving because of some shit. It was a good experience, moderating a rather large server. Some things I enjoyed and agreed, some not.
        <br>It’s been rough, but all good things come and go. You will be missed. I guess its journey will somehow continue in other servers.<br>Cheers Aurora and all the staff.</p>

      <p>Aurora was a amazing server. Nothing different could change my life. This server is where I started DISCORD from. So it is sad to see this go... It is so, so, so, sad. I rememeber the good old days. When Devon and REC were owner. It has changed
        a lot over the time. It is like I said really sad to see Aurora dieing. When I came home from school today I looked at Aurora and saw that it was ending. I was really sad. It has been a good time in Aurora.</p>

      <p>Before novus and synergy and all that, there was this server, I loved the fuck out of this server and to see it go just saddens me that nearly a year's worth of effort and work has to be wasted like this</p>
      <p>I know that I left little bits of my memories in AR Memories but it’s about time I say it<br>Aurora community has been quite the attachment to me, even before it was what it became now. Sure there was drama and a lot of bickering but in the end
        we all got out strong, the fact that this server is going to be archived in two days just makes me sad, it makes me worried about the friends I made on this server, it’s no wonder why I’ve lost most of my memories and I’m probably gonna lose a
        lot of friends<br>Just memories turned to dust<br>That’s right, my memories are nothing but stupid pieces of fluff that make you sneeze<br>Memories that will never come back
        <br<Memories…that I wish I had kept safe<br>I guess it’s time for me to make some new memories<br><br><b>All good things must come to an end…</b></p>

      <p>The decision to merge Aurora today wasn't a shocking one. Aurora has been a dormant server ever since Devon's raid. We all thought it'd be coming. Admit it, from Espi, who is "super passionate" about Aurora, is at the forefront of its death, and
        merge with NC Network, because everything needs to merge with NC apparently. That's not very relevant, however.<br><br>In conclusion, I think we should all take a lesson from this. The biggest lesson here is to hire reputable, caring staff who
        won't just let some guy steal his token. Remember Aurora mostly for its strong points, not its weak.<br><br>Thanks for all the support in Aurora over the years.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>~TRM</p>

      <p>Befriending torazer helped me accept that i was a furry, everyone in the server helped me out when I was at my lowest point when I couldn't sleep due to the pressure and discomfort that I felt when I had to come out to my parents and my depression
        that happened after some shit with my parents</p>

      <p>Aurora was the main hub for all of us for the longest time. We were all together, no drama, no "piddo" accusations, no slander, just us, and many, many others being one in a server. It was something special, we had something very little servers had,
        yes sometimes we we experienced a bit of internal drama along the way but we pulled through just fine. Since the server was created it's always been something important to me and has always had a special place in my heart, even during it's dark ages.
        I met many, many people in this server, and strengthened my friendships with people I already know, and got to know people like Sam and Devon a lot more personally. And at a time when I was just some lonely fuck sitting in my room talking to people,
        Aurora was always there. This sounds stupid, but some of my greatest moments were on Aurora and I'll never forget everything that happened and all the enjoyment we got out of it. But in the end, something like this had to happen. The server had it too good for too long,
        so myself and Squadron decided to leave. Since then, Devon took over as the main owner, and we were no longer *together*. Devon got fucked in the head and did some horrible (now forgiven) things to us, so he took Aurora completley into his own hands and thats were the servers downfall began.
        Of course it was raided later on, and refreshed by Haden, but even then he lost interest and couldn't find time or energy to keep the server alive. The place we once called home was now just this leech trying to feed off of it's former self. In it's current state, the server definetley needed to go.
        But it will always leave a significant mark in my heart and can now be remembered as the (former) centre on Discord, rather than the dump it left off as. I love you Aurora, I look forward to the future of us as people on Discord and see hope in whatever happens next,
        on our next big stop on this long road called life. 
        ~ Josh</p>
