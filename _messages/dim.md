Honestly, this is been a best server I ever seen. With Aurora I met up cool people like Red_Eye_Computing, Da532 and etc... But after nuke, Aurora just became useless because it lost 3K members and nobody joins it because it's just dead without Da532. I really miss Aurora so much, but now it's gone.. Quitely sad :(
