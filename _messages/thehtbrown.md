My first one was bad, so let's go again.

I wasn't particularly active in Aurora, but it still felt like a home. Almost everyone from it was nice to me, even if I was too socially awkward to talk about anything other than internet speeds, and I still have some friends from there today. I guess it was nice to have a community to belong to in a way. I felt like, even though I didn't talk, I was still part of something.

In the end, I'm grateful to the people who brought it back, but unfortunately everything good has to come to an end one day. Aurora's time, while great, had come to an end.
