Aurora was a amazing server. Nothing different could change my life. This server is where I started DISCORD from. So it is sad to see this go... It is so, so, so, sad. I rememeber the good old days. When Devon and REC were owner. It has changed a lot over the time. It is like I said really sad to see Aurora dieing. When I came home from school today I looked at Aurora and saw that it was ending. I was really sad. It has been a good time in Aurora.
