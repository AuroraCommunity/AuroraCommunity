I really love this place, it was fun to communicate with people (including Da532, Red_Eye_Computing, and other well-known staff). Not only that, you can also enjoy fun events, such as Karaoke Night. This is why I loved the place so much, and I had a good time spending there. Of course, I'm not always active in Aurora Community, since I have to moderate other servers. Thank you Aurora, you'll be remembered. I will see you in NC Network, where we make more fun together.

Peace out everyone, and signing off!
