Honestly, Aurora is like my child and like an insane mother I tried to smother it with a pillow, put an end to my evil child. The fact it's continued living so long has really shocked me but it's finally getting what it deserves.

__RIP AURORA__

You'll always hold a place in my heart. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i>
