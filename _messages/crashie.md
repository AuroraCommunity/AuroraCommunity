Aurora is somethings that special to not only myself but also to my heart. It's a place where I've met a lot of friends and servers. I agree that its best era was before Armada (now Novus) was a thing. I remember when I got banned here because everyone thought that I was Tim, with him in the crashie brand and all, lol. With all that being said, I'll definitely miss this place and all the good times I've had for sure.

Goodbye Aurora.
