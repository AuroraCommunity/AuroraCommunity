Even though Aurora and I have had a rough history, I still love it with all of my heart. Without Aurora, NC would be a private, awful server from my old friends, I would not have became as well known, met many people, and grown. I would not be alive, I was suicidal one night in Aurora and people actually cared. They talked me out of it. Now that Aurora is gone, it feels bad, but it was the correct thing to do. Goodbye, Aurora. I will always remember you and keep you in my heart.

From WindowsWorld to Aurora to NC - I love you all. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i>
