Ever since I joined aurora it was an amazing place, I've always wanted to become a partner ever since Da532 lost ownership of the server, I just loved being in here, until the sunset came. I sure will miss and have good memories of this place for a very long time, but some good things have to come to an end at some point. Goodbye aurora, you will be missed.
