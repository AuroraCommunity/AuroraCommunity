The decision to merge Aurora today wasn't a shocking one. Aurora has been a dormant server ever since Devon's raid. We all thought it'd be coming. Admit it. Espi, who is "super passionate" about Aurora, is at the forefront of its death, especially with the merge of NC Network. It's probably for the best, however.

In conclusion, I think we should all take a lesson from this. The biggest lesson here is to hire reputable, caring staff who won't just let some guy steal his token. Remember Aurora mostly for its strong points, not its weak.

Thanks for all the support in Aurora over the years. It's genuinely appreciated, from the bottom of my heart. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i>
