I was staff on Aurora for a brief period of time, but that doesn't matter, all that matters was that I enjoyed my time there, I met some of the greatest people that I wouldn't have met without it, with or without staff on the server, it was still a great place to be, I know sometimes it was bad with who was picked as staff \*cough\* Cameron \*cough\* but overall it was a good place to be and it died at the same way it was made, drama
