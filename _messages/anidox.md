I joined Aurora from a REC video. At first I was just there to say hi to Sam, but it turned into much more than that. I started talking to others in the server, made lots of friends and I had an amazing time. The night I got trusted I was as happy as I could be. Then, Squadron left the staff team. I applied, thinking I wouldn't get it, but I was wrong.Â¬ Again, the server made me as happy as I could be again. Slowly I got up to Head Administrator, loving every second of it. I helped as much as possible. When the nuke happened, I know it sounds a bit sad, but I was devastated. We rebuilt, but it wasn't what it was before. Without clicking that 'discord.me/AuroraCommunity' link, I wouldn't be who I am today and I wouldn't have had the experiences, knowledge, opportunities, friends and (most importantly) the fun I've had. I'll miss Aurora, but I think it's time to move on, as Aurora isn't the same anymore. Aurora has helped me through hard times and I'll sincerely miss it a ton. <i class="twa twa-heart"></i>
