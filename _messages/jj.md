Well, its closing. I found Aurora from SSL whenever drama came here, I somehow worked my way up to Admin, before leaving because of some s__t. It was a good experience, moderating a rather large server. Some things I enjoyed and agreed, some not.  
Itâ€™s been rough, but all good things come and go. You will be missed. I guess its journey will somehow continue in other servers.  
Cheers Aurora and all the staff.
