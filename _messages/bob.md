Aurora Community or Aurora, or whatever you call this server, this was REC's and Devon's server when it was first born. This server was created to be a community for Da532's fans and also REC's fan too, and for people to discuss about scambaiting, technology, and a lot more! This community kept growing and growing into a very massive community with over 3,000 members until one day... this server got NUKED! Ever since the nuke, the server never got restored back where it was before.Â¬ I guess it's time to officially end this server once for all. The server **has been closed**.

Thank you all for being part of the Aurora Community, this server has a lot of memories, without you people this server wouldn't of lasted this long.

Goodbye Aurora Commmunity for the last time, we hope we see you in NC Network.
