Before novus and synergy and all that, there was this server, I loved the f__k out of this server and to see it go just saddens me that nearly year's worth of effort and work has to be wasted like this¬

I know that I left little bits of my memories in AR Memories but it’s about time I say it
Aurora community has been quite the attachment to me, even before it was what it became now. Sure there was drama and a lot of bickering but in the end we all got out strong, the fact that this server is going to be archived in two days just makes me sad, it makes me worried about the friends I made on this server, it’s no wonder why I’ve lost most of my memories and I’m probably gonna lose a lot of friends  
Just memories turned to dust  
That’s right, my memories are nothing but stupid pieces of fluff that make you sneeze   
Memories that will never come back
Memories…that I wish I had kept safe  
I guess it’s time for me to make some new memories  

**All good things must come to an end…**
