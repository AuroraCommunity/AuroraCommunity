Aurora was the first massive server I ever joined and right from the get-go, it pretty much changed my life. I remember getting the Trusted role and it was definitely one of the best days of my life.Â¬ I joined Armada back when it was first created and I began my conquest to become staff on a major server. Soon after that, I was made staff on Armada and the demoted. Then both Armada and Aurora got nuked :(. Skip forward a few months and things have changed a lot. I was made Moderator on Armada and soon after that, we merged with WindowsWorld to create Novus. Hearing that Aurora was being shut down was some really sad news.

Thanks to everyone who made my time at Aurora awesome ;)
