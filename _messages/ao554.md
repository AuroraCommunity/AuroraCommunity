As one of the Original managers for Aurora, being one of the next to CEO high ups was a journey and also being the main person doing the charity livestreams was a really good (ill be it slightly annoying) job. I loved doing those livestreams and maintaining the server was a fun experience as well.<br>I'm sorry all things had to end like this but, Goodbye Aurora.
