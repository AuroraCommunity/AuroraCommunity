When I joined Aurora, I had no idea what I was getting into. After less then a month of being there, I was accepted as a moderator. 3 weeks later, I was banned for doing my job. I was banned for 2 weeks and I didn't really have anywhere else to go. I finally got my mod back and was later promoted to admin. I was then banned a second time for making a pedo joke about Devon. I love Aurora, but ever since the 2 nukes, it's never been the same.
