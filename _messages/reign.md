I joined Aurora to get to know Sam and his friends and hopefully become friends with him and make some content together which thankfully happened. I'm honestly glad I joined because I made so many new friends and so much new content and it's really been a blast for me. I can't wait to see where the community goes next and who'll be following it. I'll miss you aurora, thanks for everything <i class="twa twa-heart"></i>
