Watching WindowsWorld die right in front of me... Only this time, it's even more devastating. Aurora was what brought me to Discord. I don't know if I will be able to go on Discord for at least until Christmas.

From deep down in my heart  
Thank you to everyone. And most of all @Espi â€¢ AeroFusion for bringing it back...
