Aurora. Oh boy. I've been here ever since ScamCentral was a thing. I remember like it was yesterday how much fun we all had in Aurora.. But then, drama happened, it got nuked, and we tried to recover it. Unfortunately.. We weren't strong enough.

It makes me sad to see that aurora is having its.. "sunset".. I've made a lot of friends thanks to Aurora, and it sucks that things happened the way they did.

I'll miss Aurora. It was fun, but all good things come to an end eventually... Goodbye Aurora, you will be missed..
Best of wishes and love from Vlag.
