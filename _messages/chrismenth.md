I most likely would’ve killed myself if it wasn’t for aurora
Reminded of bob, joined bpc
Someone mentions SSL, so I joined it
Espi gave me an invite to nc suuuuuuuuuper long ago, applied for staff and that’s what changed my life.
Me getting that staff
It boosted my confidence
It’s sad to see aurora go
But I feel like it’s for the best
